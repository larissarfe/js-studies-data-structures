==============================> THE NULLISH COASLESCING OPERATOR: 


- Operator introduced in ES2020

- The nullish coaslescing operator works with the idea of nullish values instead of falsy values 

- AND NULLISH VALUES ARE NULL AND UNDEFINED, IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ZERO OR AN EMPTY
STRING

- FOR THE NULLINSH COASLESCING OPERATOR 0 OR '' ARE NOT FALSY VALUES AND WERE INSTEAD TRUTHY VALUES AS WELL 

- SO ONLY NULLISH VALUES WILL SHORT CIRCUIT THE EVALUATION HERE - So only if restaurant.numGuests was null or undefined - ONLY THEN THE SECOND OPERAND WOULD BE EXECUTED AND RETURNED 


restaurant.numGuests = 0;
const guest = restaurant.numGuests || 10;
console.log(guest);

const guestCorrect = restaurant.numGuests ?? 10;
console.log(guestCorrect);
