-----> NEW WAY OF LOOPING OVER ARRAYS - INTRODUCED BY ES6 


THE FOR OF LOOP 

// the for of loop  -> loop over our entire menu

const menu = [...restaurant.starterMenu, ...restaurant.mainMenu];

for (const item of menu) console.log(item); // all the items will be logged individually in the console

// so this loop will automatically loop over the intire array and in each iteration it will give us access to the current array element
// which we specify with the variable item - the item variable is always the current element in each iteration

// WE CAN ALSO USE THE KEYWORD CONTINUE AND BREAK HERE
// just like an if/else statement we don't need a code block when we only have one statement to execute

// What if we want also the current index and not just the current element?
for (const [i, el] of menu.entries()) {
  console.log(`${i + 1}: ${el}`);
}

//BUT WE CAN DESTRUCTURE IT -> const [i, el]

console.log(menu.entries());
