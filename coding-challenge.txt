1- Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1') and 'players2'

2- The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field players. For bayern munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') for field players with all the remaining 10 field players 

3- create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)

4- during the game, team1  used 3 substitute players. So create a new array ('playersFinal') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho', 'Perisic'

5- Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called 'team1', 'draw', 'team2')



// 1- Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and 'players2'):

const [players1, []] = game.players;
console.log(players1);

const [, players2] = game.players;

console.log(players2);

// 2- The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field players.
// For bayern munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') for field players with all the remaining 10 field players

const gkTeam1 = players1[0];
console.log(gkTeam1);

const [a, ...fieldPlayers1] = players1;

console.log(fieldPlayers1);

const gkTeam2 = players2[0];
console.log(gkTeam2);
const [b, ...fieldPlayers2] = players2;

console.log(fieldPlayers2);

// 3- create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)

const allPlayers = [...players1, ...players2];
console.log(allPlayers);

// 4- during the game, team1  used 3 substitute players. So create a new array ('playersFinal') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho', 'Perisic'

const playersFinal = [...players1, 'Thiago', 'Coutinho', 'Perisic'];

console.log(playersFinal);

// 5- based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called 'team1', 'draw', 'team2')

const { team1, x: draw, team2 } = game.odds;

console.log(team1, draw, team2);

// 6- write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player names (NOT AN ARRAY) and print each of them in the console
// along with the number of goals who were scored (number of player names passed in)

printGoals: function (...players) {
    console.log(...players);
    console.log(`${players.length} goals were scored`);
  },

game.printGoals('Davis', 'Miller', 'Lewandowski', 'Kimmich');
game.printGoals('Davis', 'Miller');
game.printGoals(...game.scored);

// 7- Print to the console which team is more likely to win based on the odds variable WITHOUT if/else statement or ternary operator
// the team with a lowe odd is more likely to win

// the and operator
team1 < team2 && console.log('Team 1 is more likely to win');
team1 > team2 && console.log('Team 2 is more likely to win');

// we want the evaluation console.log to be printed if the result of the operation before is true

// the or operator short circuits if the first value is true but that's not what we want because if so the cl won't be evaluated
